#Esri Polymer  

This project has turned Esri JavaScript web maps into web components that can be used to create maps decleratively to HTML. It leverages Googles Polymer library which allows users to create custom web components.

It currently supports:

* esri-map - Attributes: basemap, zoom, centerLng, centerLat, webMapId (you can use a web map ID to pull through a map)

* esri-featurelayer - Attributes: featurelayer (the feature service url)


#Live Demo

You can see a live demo [here](http://appsstage.esriuk.com/app/developerevangelist/93/wmt/view/d147785761984557b69c73adf4a8e2da/esri-polymer/esri-polymer.html "Esri Polymer Live Demo")

It displays one web map constructed using attributes (basemap, zoom, etc), with a feature layer web component nested inside it and a second map constructed with a web map ID.
